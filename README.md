# Telesa English - Assignment (Demo)

## Install & Run

1. Clone repo
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run `flutter run`

## What’s Done

- Mobile App (Flutter)
    - Home screen UI (recommendations, progress overview)
    - Teacher screen UI (list of teachers with static data)

## What’s Missing

- Booking screen
- Progress tracking screen
- Notifications
- State management (Bloc not yet implemented)
- API integration (currently using static mock data)
- Admin Dashboard (Web/Laravel)

## Next Steps (If more time)

- Add missing screens (Booking, Progress, Notifications)
- Implement Bloc for state management
- Connect to API (stub)
- Build Admin Dashboard for teachers, revenue, transactions
- Add notification flow & booking confirmation

## Notes

Due to limited time, I focused on the UI part first.
The project is already structured so logic and API can be added easily.
